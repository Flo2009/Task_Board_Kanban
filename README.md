# Task_Board_KANBAN

## Description

- The motivation for the project is to have a KANBAN driven task board to organize yourself better
- The projects allowed me to have exposure to jquery and bootstrap and further understand the technologies
  It also allowed me to refine my troubleshooting skills using the browser inspection tool.
- The problem that needed solving in this case was that the code was unfinished, a modal needed to be created using the bootstrap framework
  and the js needed completion to make the page fully functional.
- I learned to troubleshoot with the browser tools to find out which data was passed and used. I learned to understand how the jquery library works.
  I had to understand the bootstrap framework and how the grid structure works.

## Usage

To use the KANBAN Task Board you click on the "Add Task" button. A modal opens up and you can enter your task description, the due date and the task content.
When the tasks progress you can shift them from "to-do" to "in-Progress" or to "done". After completion or in case the task got obsolete you can delete the task by 
applying the "Delete" button on the Task Card.
